## API client class usage examples
This directory contains some PHP code examples which demonstrate usage of the PHP API client class and can be used as a good starting point for your own custom code.

### Usage

Copy the appropriate example file to your working directory together with a copy of the config.template.php file which should be renamed to config.php.
Then update the contents of your new config.php with your controller details and credentials and modify the example file as required to fit your needs.

### Contribute

## Provisioning script

The example provision script easily creates a large number of sites with comparable network configuration. It sets the LAN config 
to site specific configuration. Copy the settings.template.php and config.template.php to their respective files for testing. This is meant as a
basic provisioning only system. Currently used against controller 5.6.30.
