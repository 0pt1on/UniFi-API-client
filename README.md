## UniFi controller API client class

This PHP class provides access to Ubiquiti's **UniFi Controller API**. Versions 4.x.x and 5.x.x of the UniFi Controller software (version 5.5.20 has been confirmed to work) are supported. It is an independent version of the class which is used in the API browser tool [here](https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-browser).

## Credits

This class is largely based on the work done by the following developers:
- domwo: http://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Wireless/little-php-class-for-unifi-api/m-p/603051
- fbagnol: https://github.com/fbagnol/class.unifi.php
- and the API as published by Ubiquiti: https://www.ubnt.com/downloads/unifi/5.5.20/unifi_sh_api

## Requirements

- a web server with PHP and cURL modules installed (tested on apache2 with PHP Version 5.6.1 and cURL 7.42.1)
- network connectivity between this web server and the server and port (normally port 8443) where the UniFi controller is running

## Installation ##

You can use **Composer** or simply **Download the Release**

### Composer

The preferred method is via [composer](https://getcomposer.org). Follow the [installation instructions](https://getcomposer.org/doc/00-intro.md) if you do not already have composer installed.

Once composer is installed, simply execute this command from your project directory:

```sh
composer require art-of-wifi/unifi-api-client
```

Finally, be sure to include the autoloader in your code:

```php
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');
```

### Download the Release

If you prefer not to use composer, you can simply [download the package](https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-client/archive/master.zip), uncompress the zip file, then in your code include the file containing the class like so:

```php
require_once('path/to/src/Client.php');
```

## Example usage

A basic example how to use the class:

```php
/**
 * load the class using the composer autoloader
 */
require_once('vendor/autoload.php');

/**
 * initialize the Unifi API connection class, log in to the controller and request the alarms collection
 * (this example assumes you have already assigned the correct values to the variables used)
 */
$unifi_connection = new UniFi_API\Client($controller_user, $controller_password, $controller_url, $site_id, $controller_version);
$login            = $unifi_connection->login();
$results          = $unifi_connection->list_alarms(); // returns the alarms in a PHP array
```

Please refer to the `examples` directory for some more detailed examples which you can use as a starting point for your own PHP code.

### NOTE:

In the example above, $site_id is the 8 character short site "name" which is visible in the URL when managing the site in the UniFi controller:

`https://<controller IP address or FQDN>:8443/manage/site/jl3z2shm/dashboard`

In this case, `jl3z2shm` is the value required for $site_id.

## Need help or have suggestions?

There is still work to be done to add functionality and improve the usability of this class, so all suggestions/comments are welcome. Please use the github [issue](https://github.com/Art-of-WiFi/UniFi-API-client/issues) list or the Ubiquiti Community forums (https://community.ubnt.com/t5/UniFi-Wireless/PHP-class-to-access-the-UniFi-controller-API-updates-and/td-p/1512870) to share your ideas.
